## Explain 
Template Section: You're using the Vuetify framework to create a user interface.
You have a <v-container> that wraps your content.
Inside the container, you're using a loop (v-for) to iterate over an array of users (users array in your data).
For each user, you're creating a <v-card> with user information, such as name, studentID, and email.
You display the user's name and studentID using <v-list> and <v-list-item>.
Additionally, you display the email outside the list structure.

Script Section: In the script section, you've defined a Vue component using export default {}.
You've initialized the component's data with an array of users, each having name, studentID, and email properties.

Data Section: The data() function returns an object with an array called users. 
This array contains four user objects, each with properties like name, studentID, and email.

Styling: You're using Vuetify classes for styling, such as mx-auto for horizontal centering, mt-2, mt-3 for margin-top, rounded="xl" for rounded corners, etc.

## Instruction
You need to create skeleton of your project's development. It does not necessary include the complete source code. Please follow instructions below:
- Edit readme file that briefly explains your project and details of members.​ 
- Create folder structure and some source code to prepare for development
- Decide what features to roll out and who is responsible for it.​ Create branches for each feature. Explain each feature in Readme file in their own branch​ 
- Create Docker file for your deployment of your application
