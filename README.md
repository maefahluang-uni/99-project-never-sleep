## Feature

One notable feature in your code is the dynamic and personalized representation of users through the use of personalized icons. Each user is associated with a distinct icon (e.g., 'mdi-account-injury', 'mdi-account-school', etc.), providing a visual representation of their role or characteristic. This feature enhances the user interface by making it visually engaging and allowing users to quickly identify and distinguish between different users. The use of personalized icons contributes to a more user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing design.
