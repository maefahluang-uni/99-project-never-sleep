## Explain 
1. **User Cards:**
   - The webpage displays information cards for multiple users.
   - Each card shows the user's name, student ID, email, and a personalized icon.
   - Icons are different for each user and represent various roles or characteristics.

2. **Icons:**
   - Users are associated with icons like an injury, a school, a tie with a hat, or a generic account icon.
   - These icons are visually represented on the user cards.

3. **Vue.js Component:**
   - The code is written in Vue.js, a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
   - It uses Vuetify, a Vue.js component library, for styling and UI components.

4. **Data:**
   - User information is stored in a data array called `users`.
   - Each user is an object with properties like `icon`, `name`, `studentID`, and `email`.

5. **Looping Through Users:**
   - The code uses a loop to iterate over the `users` array and dynamically create a card for each user.

6. **Styling:**
   - Styling is done using Vuetify classes (e.g., `mx-auto` for centering, `mt-2` for margin-top, etc.).

## Instruction
You need to create skeleton of your project's development. It does not necessary include the complete source code. Please follow instructions below:
- Edit readme file that briefly explains your project and details of members.​ 
- Create folder structure and some source code to prepare for development
- Decide what features to roll out and who is responsible for it.​ Create branches for each feature. Explain each feature in Readme file in their own branch​ 
- Create Docker file for your deployment of your application
